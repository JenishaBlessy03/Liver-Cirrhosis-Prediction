# Liver-Cirrhosis-Prediction

Liver Cirrhosis Stage Classification using Machine Learning :

This project uses a Voting Classifier ensemble of CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM to predict the stage of liver cirrhosis based on medical report inputs. It also generates a detailed PDF report with prediction results, confidence scores, and medical insights to assist healthcare professionals in documentation and decision-making.

Problem Statement :

Liver cirrhosis is a progressive disease that can be life-threatening if undetected. This machine learning project helps classify the condition into one of the following stages:

Stage 0: No Cirrhosis
Stage 1: Early
Stage 2: Moderate
Stage 3: Severe
